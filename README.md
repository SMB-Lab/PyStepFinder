# PyStepFinder. Author: George Hamilton (ghamil4)
This tool is a Python implementation of a trace data step/change-point finding algorithm. This project was intended as a tool for analysis of fluorescence time-trace data associated with single-molecule FRET experiments and is under active development. The scripts were written in part for participation in the KinSoft challenge (link will be provided upon publication) and the example data included within this repository were generated using the MatLab script provided by the authors of the corresponding publication.
